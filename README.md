# gomosaic
gomosaic is an mosaic image generator written entirely in Go. In short: It manages an image database and given a query image returns the image composed or "approximated" of images from the database. The methods implemented are mostly based on "On the use of CBIR in image mosaic generation" by Yue Zhang, 2002, University of Alberta.
TODO provide WIKI with information.

## Background
The project originate from a Golang introduction course where I was looking for a project for the participants. Since mosaic generation is not very hard to understand and the modules can be implemented independently (and in teams) I chose this topic. I still think it's a nice project for people trying to learn Go. So if you like the idea you can use my skeleton (TODO link). The skeleton might differ from the implementation here.
